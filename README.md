# ML Foundations: Small-Scale Practice on Classification Models

This repository is part of my ongoing effort to strengthen core machine learning foundations through both practical and conceptual exercises. It includes a complete classification workflow on a small dataset ‚Äî from data inspection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and reflection. A parallel theory notebook supports a deeper understanding of key algorithms.

> ‚ö† This is a foundational project focused on **skill-building**, not performance. The dataset is intentionally small ‚Äî to emphasize clarity in workflows, evaluation metrics, and model behavior before scaling up to real-world data.

## Why This Project?

While I have previously worked on advanced deep learning research (published and awarded), this repository reflects a different phase in my journey:  
- Revisiting ML fundamentals to build stronger clarity  
- Practicing full end-to-end pipelines  
- Gaining confidence across multiple models and tools  
- Laying the groundwork for more complex, applied projects ‚Äî especially in healthcare and social good domains

## Project Structure

### 1. `MentalHealth_Classification.ipynb`  
An applied classification notebook using a small real-world dataset.  
**Includes:**  
- Data exploration and visualization  
- Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding)  
- Model training: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score (macro & weighted)  
- Reflections on performance and model behavior

### 2. `ML_Model_Notes_and_Comparisons.ipynb`  
A conceptual notebook for building algorithmic intuition.  
**Includes:**  
- What each model is used for  
- Simplified explanations of how they work  
- Assumptions, strengths, and limitations  
- Use cases and glossary  
- Visual demo (Logistic Regression so far)

> **Note:** More models will be added as this personal series evolves ‚Äî this is an ongoing learning repository.

### 3. `mental_health_survey.csv`  
The toy dataset used in the applied notebook. Included for reproducibility.

## Next Steps (Coming Soon)

- Add conceptual notes and visual demos for more models  
- Transition to larger, real-world datasets and applied problem settings  
- Integrate projects aligned with health and social impact use cases
